          <p>This was a project done by Joseph Wangemann and myself.</p>
          <p>The project was created using the HTML programming language.</p>
          <p>this was a simple webpage project, with a gif for fun. My experiance wiht HMTL is currently limited but it was a fun peice to work on nonetheless.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons for the projects subject is my son Alex (whose 8) loves black holes.</p>
